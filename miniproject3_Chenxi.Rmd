## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r bfi}
data(bfi)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r EFA}
# Calculate the correlation matrix first
EFA.cor <- cor(bfi, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
# Then use that correlation matrix to create the scree plot
scree(EFA.cor, factors = FALSE)

#We call also use the Very Simple Structure (VSS) to determine the actual 
#numbers of the factors 

vss(bfi, rotate = "none")

# Run the EFA with six factors (as indicated by your scree plot)
EFA.mod <- fa(bfi, nfactors = 6)

# View results from the model object
EFA.mod
fa.diagram(EFA.mod)
```
And then we compare with 5 factors and 7 factors.
```{r}
# Comparing EFA with six factors and theorized CFA with five factors

# Run each theorized EFA on your dataset
EFA.mod.5 <- fa(bfi, nfactors = 5)
summary(EFA.mod.5)

EFA.mod.7 <- fa(bfi, nfactors = 7)
summary(EFA.mod.7)

# Compare the BIC values
EFA.mod.5$BIC
EFA.mod.7$BIC

```
We know the 5 factors model:

[1] The Chi Square is lower than threshhold 0.05, which means there is a significant differences between model and observed data.
[2] RMSEA index is 0.057, which means a bad fit efficency.
[3] Tucker Lewis Index is 0.834, which means we have a good validity in this model.
[4] We can check the matrix between different factors and find the highest relationship represents in MR1 and MR2.

And through the comparsion of 5 factors model and 7 factors model, we can conclude that:

[1] In most case like RMSEA and Tucker Lewis, the 7 factors model has a better fit compared with 5 factors model.
